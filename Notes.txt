VIRTUALIZATION
-------------------------------------------------

Virtual Machines are created on top of a Hypervisor, which runs on top of the Host Machine's Operating System. With Hypervisor, we emulate hardware like CPU, Disk, Network, Memory and install Guest Machines on it.

Examples of Hypervisors:
- KVM
- Xen
- VMWare
- VirtualBox
- Hyper-V



KVM:

Kernel-based Virtual Machine is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware.

It is an Open Source software. It supports various OSes like, Linux, Windows, Solaris.

KVM does not perform any emulator itself, but exposes the /dev/kvm interface, by which an external userspace host can do emulation. QEMU is one such host.

Benefits of Using KVM
Some of the benefits of using KVM are:

- It is an Open Source solution, and, as such, free to customize.
- Using KVM is efficient from a financial perspective as well, due to the lower costs associated with it.
- It is highly scalable.
- KVM employs advanced security features, utilizing SELinux. It provides MAC (Mandatory Access Control) security between Virtual Machines. KVM has received awards for meeting common government and military security standards  and for allowing open virtualization for homeland security projects.

VirtualBox:

Vagrant:

Used to automate the creation and deletion of VMs: Shell, Docker, Ansible


-------------------------------------------------
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
-------------------------------------------------

IaaS is a form of Cloud Computing which provides on-demand physical and virtual computing resources, storage, network, firewall, load balancers, etc. To provide virtual computing resources, IaaS uses some form of Hypervisor, like Xen, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, Hyper-V, etc.

IaaS is the backbone of all cloud services, providing the compute resources. After getting the compute resources, we provide other services on top of that.
